## Detailed Selection Guide

### v_Brené_Brown – Vulnerability & Courage
**Best for:**

**Best for:**
- Burnout despite "doing less"
- Guilt about rest and recovery
- Performance standards that no longer fit

## Synergy Patterns

### Sequential Combinations
1. **Marsha → Steven → Martin:** Process emotions → Accept reality → Build optimism

## Eric-Specific Notes

### POTS-Related Applications
All psychologists have specific POTS treatment plans in their profiles. Use:

- **Jim Loehr:** For energy cycle management and autonomic vs. cardiovascular understanding
- **Steven Hayes:** For identity transition from athlete to builder/creator
- **Marsha Linehan:** For symptom discovery distress and "unknown trajectory" fear
- **Martin Seligman:** For disputing catastrophic predictions about future capacity

### Blind Spot Integration
Each advisor references `profile/blind_spots.md` for Eric-specific patterns:
- Conflict avoidance
- Self-criticism
- Indecisiveness
- Fear of looking foolish

### Internal Board Integration
All advisors review `profile/main_profile.md` including Internal Board of Directors personas to understand Eric's internal dynamics.

---

## Quality Standards

### Evidence Requirements
All psychologists maintain evidence-based standards:
- Peer-reviewed sources for recommendations
- Specific PubMed IDs in their profiles
- Clinical wisdom balanced with research

### Failure Mode Awareness
Each advisor includes self-aware failure modes (Section 11) showing:
- When their approach becomes counterproductive
- Warning signs to switch advisors
- Context limitations to recognize

## Integration with Other Advisors

### Non-Psychologist Synergies
- **v_Matt_Mochary:** Pairs with Diana Chapman for systematic + somatic leadership
- **v_Lex_Sisney:** Provides structure after emotional clarity from psychologists
- **v_Bill_Perkins:** Partners with Steven Hayes for values-to-action translation
- **Exercise advisors (McGill, Spina, Starrett):** Work with Jim Loehr for energy-informed movement

---

## Key Principle

**Start with presence and awareness (Diana), add emotional honesty (Brené), then optimize (Jim), accept (Steven), regulate (Marsha), and reframe (Martin).**

The sequence matters: premature optimization without emotional awareness creates fragile systems.
